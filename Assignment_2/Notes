mnist_mlp:
Acc with categorical cross entropy 98%
Most missclassified digits: 8 with accuracy 94.15% (4 second time)
                            4 with accuracy 97.86% (3 second time)
                            9 with accuracy 98.02% (5 second time)
Acc with mean squared error: 98% 
Most missclassified digits: 5 with accuracy 96.19% (9 second time)
                            8 with accuracy 96.82% (5 second time)
                            9 with accuracy 97.20% (8 second time)
Results are inconsistent, top 3 missclassified digits changes every time but some of the digits appear more often. Accuracy is consistently 98%-98.5%.

mnist_cnn:
Acc with categorical cross entropy 99%
Most missclassified digits: 8 with accuracy 98.36% 
                            6 with accuracy 98.43% 
                            9 with accuracy 98.51% 
Acc with mean squared error: 98.5% 
Most missclassified digits: 9 with accuracy 97.32% 
                            8 with accuracy 98.05% 
                            7 with accuracy 98.05% 
Clearly 8 and 9 are consistently appear in the top 3. Accuracy seems to be lower with MSE as loss function. Training takes 20 minutes, so measuring how randomness influences the results is hard.

Permuting the mnist dataset does not influence the result significantly
